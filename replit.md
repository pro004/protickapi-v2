# Xrotick API Documentation

## Overview

Xrotick API is a modern, interactive API documentation and testing platform built with Express.js backend and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The system provides a sleek, dark-themed dashboard for developers to explore, test, and integrate APIs with real-time response visualization and comprehensive documentation features.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Server Configuration**: 
  - Port: 4000 (configurable via environment)
  - Trust proxy enabled for deployment compatibility
  - JSON formatting with 2-space indentation
- **Middleware Stack**:
  - JSON body parser for API request handling
  - URL-encoded body parser for form data
  - CORS support for cross-origin requests
  - Custom JSON response middleware for consistent API responses

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript
- **Design Pattern**: Static file serving from `/web` directory
- **UI Features**:
  - Dark theme with modern animations
  - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Interactive API testing interface
  - Real-time JSON response visualization
  - Categorized navigation with search functionality

### Configuration Management
- **Settings File**: `settings.json` for dynamic configuration
- **Exposed Endpoint**: `/settings.json` serves configuration to frontend
- **Customizable Elements**:
  - API metadata (name, version, description)
  - Header configuration with status and imagery
  - External links and contact information
  - System notifications

## Key Components

### 1. Main Server (`index.js`)
- **Purpose**: Core Express server setup and middleware configuration
- **Key Features**:
  - Static file serving for web assets
  - Dynamic API module loading from `/api` directory
  - Custom JSON response formatting with operator attribution
  - Settings exposure for frontend consumption

### 2. API Module System
- **Structure**: Modular API organization in `/api` folder
- **Loading Strategy**: Recursive module discovery and registration
- **Route Counting**: Automatic tracking of total registered routes

### 3. Configuration System (`settings.json`)
- **API Settings**: Operator attribution and metadata
- **UI Configuration**: Header status, images, and sizing
- **External Integrations**: Links and contact information
- **Notification System**: Built-in notification management

### 4. Package Management
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Core: Express.js, CORS, body-parser
  - Utilities: Chalk for logging, Axios for HTTP requests
  - Specialized: Cheerio for HTML parsing, yt-search, spotidownloader
- **Development**: Nodemon for development server

## Data Flow

1. **Request Processing**:
   - Client requests hit Express server
   - Middleware processes JSON/URL-encoded bodies
   - CORS headers applied for cross-origin support
   - Custom JSON middleware enhances responses

2. **Static Asset Serving**:
   - Frontend assets served from `/web` directory
   - Settings configuration exposed via `/settings.json` endpoint

3. **API Module Integration**:
   - Dynamic loading of API modules from `/api` directory
   - Automatic route registration and counting
   - Consistent response formatting across all endpoints

4. **Response Enhancement**:
   - All JSON responses augmented with status and operator information
   - Maintains compatibility with existing API module responses
